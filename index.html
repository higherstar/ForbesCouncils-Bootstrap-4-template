              Forbes, one of the most iconic media companies in the world, and the team behind YEC, a world-class entrepreneurship organization, have partnered to create a new kind of professional community — Forbes Councils.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team spent years talking to top professionals about what was working, and what was broken, in their business relationships and communities. What we found was an industry in need of a major update — one stuck in the trading-business-cards age of networking, offering little more than superficial relationships and benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we set out to create something different. Leaning on YEC’s deep understanding of community building and Forbes’ global reach and resources, we’ve created a space for exceptional business owners and leaders to come together with the people and resources that can help them thrive.
            </p>

          <div class="col p-0">
            <p>Through our selection process, we recruit and invite members not just on the basis of career success, but on their diversity of perspective and willingness to give as much as they gain. We bring these members together in communities tailored to their industry or region so that they can connect with others best positioned to help them overcome challenges and create new opportunities.</p>
            <p>Finally, we provide members with a growing list of support benefits that help them save time and money, and a platform, CommunityVoice on Forbes.com, through which they can amplify their voices and exchange ideas.</p>
            <p>At Forbes Councils, we believe that behind each of the world’s most successful business owners and leaders is a strong community of support. <a href="https://forbescouncils.com/qualify">Find yours in a Forbes Council today</a>.</p>
